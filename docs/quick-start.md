# Quick Start Guide

Get up and running with the RANZ Roofing Report platform in 5 minutes.

## 1. Log In

Navigate to **reports.ranz.org.nz** and sign in with your RANZ Quality Program credentials. If you already have a session on **portal.ranz.org.nz**, you will be signed in automatically via SSO.

If you do not have an account, contact your RANZ administrator to be set up on the Quality Program portal first.

## 2. Complete Onboarding

First-time users are guided through a **6-step onboarding wizard**:

| Step | What You Enter |
|------|----------------|
| 1. Welcome | Overview of the platform |
| 2. Profile | Name, email, phone number |
| 3. Qualifications | LBP number, years of experience, specialisations |
| 4. Company | Company name, business address |
| 5. Preferences | Default inspection type, default region, notification settings |
| 6. Complete | Confirmation and redirect to dashboard |

Your progress is saved automatically. If you close the browser, you will resume where you left off.

## 3. Create Your First Report

From the **Dashboard** (`/dashboard`), click **New Report**. The 3-step form collects:

1. **Property Details** — Street address, city, region, postcode, property type, building age
2. **Inspection Details** — Date, inspection type, weather conditions, access method, limitations
3. **Client Information** — Client name, email, phone

Click **Create Report** to generate a draft with a report number in the format `RR-YYYY-NNNNN`.

## 4. Build Your Report

You are taken to the **Report Detail** page (`/reports/[id]`), which is your hub. From here, use the quick-action tiles to:

- **Roof Elements** — Document each roof component (cladding, ridge, valley, gutters, flashings, etc.) with condition ratings
- **Defects** — Record defects using the Observation > Analysis > Opinion structure, with severity and code references
- **Photos** — Upload inspection photos. EXIF metadata (GPS, timestamp, camera) is extracted automatically
- **Videos** — Upload supporting video evidence
- **Documents** — Attach building consents, manufacturer specs, or previous reports
- **Compliance** — Complete the E2/B2/COP compliance assessment checklists
- **Executive Summary** — Write the key findings summary

## 5. Check the Pre-Submission Checklist

When you are ready, click **Submit** from the report detail page. The system validates 6 areas:

- Property details are complete
- Inspection details are complete
- Minimum roof elements documented
- Minimum photos uploaded (with EXIF metadata count)
- Defects documented
- Compliance assessment coverage

Any missing items are highlighted with direct links to fix them.

## 6. Sign and Submit

Once all validation checks pass:

1. Complete the **Expert Witness Declaration** (7 mandatory checkboxes covering expertise, code of conduct, impartiality, conflict of interest, inspection methodology, evidence integrity, and court compliance)
2. Disclose any **conflict of interest** if applicable
3. Draw your **digital signature**
4. Click **Submit for Review**

Your report moves to **Pending Review** status. You will receive a notification when a reviewer takes action.
